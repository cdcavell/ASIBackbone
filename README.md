`CDCavell.AsiBackbone` is a .NET package family for building an **Accountable Systems Infrastructure Backbone** around consequential software actions.

In this software project, **ASI** means **Accountable Systems Infrastructure**. The package name uses `AsiBackbone` to preserve stable .NET identifiers, while the documentation frames the acronym as governance infrastructure rather than artificial superintelligence.

It helps a host application evaluate intent before execution, apply policy constraints, require acknowledgment when needed, preserve audit residue, and optionally scope follow-on execution through capability tokens.

AsiBackbone should be understood as **governance infrastructure**, not an intelligence engine.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> These packages do **not** implement artificial superintelligence, host AI models, train AI models, control robots, or prove the Eden/Backbone framework. They provide framework-neutral building blocks and host integration seams for governing consequential actions in software systems.

## What problem does this solve?

Many systems eventually need more than ordinary authorization and application logging.

A consequential action may need to answer:

- Is this action allowed right now?
- Which constraints, policies, and reason codes shaped the decision?
- Does this request require human acknowledgment before execution?
- Which policy version and policy hash were active?
- Can execution be scoped through a short-lived capability token?
- Can a reviewer later understand why the system allowed, warned, denied, deferred, required acknowledgment, or recommended escalation?

AsiBackbone focuses on that decision boundary: the point between proposed intent and host execution.

## What does it do?

A typical AsiBackbone flow is:

```text
Intent or request
  -> Build policy context
  -> Evaluate constraints
  -> Compose decision result
  -> Require acknowledgment when needed
  -> Write audit residue
  -> Issue optional scoped capability token
  -> Host application decides whether and how to execute
```

Core benefits include:

| Benefit | What it means |
| --- | --- |
| Policy-driven decision gating | Proposed actions can be evaluated before the host executes them. |
| Explicit decision outcomes | Decisions can be allowed, warned, denied, deferred, acknowledgment-required, or escalation-recommended. |
| Human acknowledgment workflow | Consequential actions can pause until an actor acknowledges responsibility, risk, or intent. |
| Audit residue | Decisions can preserve reason codes, policy version, policy hash, correlation ID, timestamp, and metadata. |
| Capability-scoped execution | Follow-on execution can be represented as a short-lived, scoped permission grant. |
| Host-owned integration | Applications keep ownership of the web host, persistence lifecycle, migrations, deployment, and execution behavior. |
| Framework-neutral core | Core primitives can be used without requiring ASP.NET Core, EF Core, NetCoreApplicationTemplate, AI packages, or robotics dependencies. |

See [Why AsiBackbone?](docs/articles/why-asi-backbone.md) for a fuller benefits overview.

## Who is this for?

AsiBackbone may be useful for:

- Enterprise .NET applications with consequential administrative actions.
- AI-agent gateways that need policy checks before tool or API execution.
- Human-in-the-loop workflows where approval or acknowledgment matters.
- Government, public-sector, education, healthcare, finance, legal, or other regulated systems that need stronger auditability.
- Platform engineering workflows that need clear allow, deny, defer, acknowledgment, or escalation decisions before external execution.
- Applications that need capability-scoped grants instead of broad, long-lived authority.

## What does it not do?

AsiBackbone does not:

- Replace normal authentication or authorization.
- Guarantee compliance with any law, regulation, audit framework, or security standard.
- Host, train, run, or orchestrate AI models.
- Implement artificial superintelligence.
- Execute tools, APIs, infrastructure changes, or robot commands by itself.
- Own the consuming application's database, migrations, deployment, or operational policy.
- Replace legal review, AI safety governance, organizational accountability, or operational security.

The host application remains responsible for execution behavior and operational controls.

## Current Status

Early alpha package family.

The repository has completed the initial Core foundation work and now includes optional persistence packages for in-memory validation, EF Core host-owned persistence, and ASP.NET Core integration. Planned follow-up milestones include samples and host validation, signing support, gateway integrations, robotics examples, and stable release packaging.

## Project Direction

AsiBackbone is planned as a host-integrated .NET module ecosystem.

The Core package answers:

> What are the shared AsiBackbone abstractions and domain primitives?

Integration packages answer narrower host-boundary questions, such as:

> How can AsiBackbone accountability records be persisted in a host-owned database?
> How can AsiBackbone be exposed through web middleware or endpoints?
> How can a sample host wire policy evaluation, acknowledgment, audit, and capability boundaries together?

The package family should not answer:

> Which host application template must be used?
> Which AI model, if any, produced the request being governed?
> How are physical or robotic systems controlled?
> Which database provider or migration process must the host use?

Those concerns belong to consuming applications, provider-specific packages, or later gateway samples.

## Core Domain Language

Important terms:

| Term | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| Accountable Systems Infrastructure | The project meaning of ASI: infrastructure that makes consequential software decisions policy-shaped, auditable, acknowledgment-aware, and capability-bounded. |
| Governance spine | The software path that every consequential action follows before execution. |
| Intent or request | The proposed action that needs evaluation. |
| Constraint | A rule, policy, condition, or boundary that narrows available outcomes. |
| Active policy structure | The set of constraints in force for a decision at a specific moment. |
| Collapse boundary | The practical software point where open possibility becomes a concrete decision or action. |
| Actor context | The framework-neutral description of who or what is requesting the action. |
| Policy context | The evaluation input assembled from actor, intent, resource, risk, policy, and correlation data. |
| Decision result | The governance output, such as allow, warn, deny, defer, require acknowledgment, or escalate. |
| Operation result | The package execution result, separate from the governance decision outcome. |
| Audit residue | The trace left by decision flow: reason codes, policy version, hash, correlation ID, timestamp, and related metadata. |
| Acknowledgment workflow | A responsibility or reflexive acknowledgment step before consequential action. |
| Capability token | A short-lived, scoped, traceable permission grant. |
| Gateway boundary | The validation boundary before a decision reaches an external or consequential system. |

## `0.1.0-alpha.1` Core Boundary

The original `0.1.0-alpha.1` boundary is language and primitives only.

`CDCavell.AsiBackbone.Core` may include:

- Framework-neutral domain abstractions
- Actor context primitives
- Policy context primitives
- Constraint evaluation contracts
- Decision result primitives
- Operation result primitives
- Reason code primitives
- Acknowledgment or responsibility-handshake abstractions
- Audit residue abstractions
- Capability-token abstractions
- Policy version and policy hash fields
- Correlation ID support
- Shared value objects
- XML documentation for public types

`CDCavell.AsiBackbone.Core` should avoid:

- Entity Framework Core dependencies
- ASP.NET Core dependencies
- Web middleware
- Endpoint mapping
- Host application startup logic
- Database provider assumptions
- Direct dependencies on NetCoreApplicationTemplate
- Concrete ledger or database persistence
- Concrete signing or key-management implementation
- Robotics control implementation
- AI model hosting, training, inference, or orchestration

## `0.2.0-alpha.1` Persistence Boundary

The `0.2.0-alpha.1` persistence milestone adds optional storage packages without changing Core's host-neutral boundary.

The persistence package line includes:

- `CDCavell.AsiBackbone.Storage.InMemory` for local validation, tests, and samples.
- `CDCavell.AsiBackbone.EntityFrameworkCore` for EF Core model configuration and audit ledger persistence through a host-owned `DbContext`.

The EF Core package supports host-owned persistence. AsiBackbone contributes model configuration and storage helpers, while the consuming application owns the `DbContext`, database provider, connection string, migrations, deployment, and schema lifecycle.

The preferred persistence model is host-owned data access:

> AsiBackbone owns its domain model.<br />
> The host application owns the DbContext.<br />
> AsiBackbone provides model configuration hooks.<br />

See [EF Core Integration Boundary](docs/articles/ef-core-integration-boundary.md) and [EF Core Host Ownership and Migration Guidance](docs/articles/ef-core-host-ownership-and-migrations.md) for details.

## Package Boundary

`CDCavell.AsiBackbone.Core` is responsible for:

- Core domain abstractions
- Policy and constraint contracts
- Decision/result primitives
- Acknowledgment and audit abstractions
- Capability-token abstractions
- Shared options and value objects when needed
- Assembly markers or discovery-friendly primitives
- Framework-neutral domain language

`CDCavell.AsiBackbone.Core` should avoid:

- Entity Framework Core dependencies
- ASP.NET Core dependencies
- Web middleware
- Endpoint mapping
- Host application startup logic
- Database provider assumptions
- Direct dependencies on NetCoreApplicationTemplate
- AI model dependencies
- Robotics or physical execution dependencies

## Package Family

The current and planned package family is:

```text
CDCavell.AsiBackbone.Core
CDCavell.AsiBackbone.Storage.InMemory
CDCavell.AsiBackbone.EntityFrameworkCore
CDCavell.AsiBackbone.AspNetCore
CDCavell.AsiBackbone.Signing
CDCavell.AsiBackbone.Samples
CDCavell.AsiBackbone.Robotics
```

Package names may be adjusted before stable release.

### CDCavell.AsiBackbone.Core

Current package.

Defines framework-neutral domain abstractions and primitives.

### CDCavell.AsiBackbone.Storage.InMemory

Current package.

Provides non-durable in-memory storage helpers for local validation, samples, and tests. It should not be used as durable production storage.

### CDCavell.AsiBackbone.EntityFrameworkCore

Current package.

Provides EF Core model contributions and audit ledger persistence integration. The host application owns the `DbContext`, provider, connection string, migrations, deployment, and schema lifecycle.

### CDCavell.AsiBackbone.AspNetCore

Current package.

Provides ASP.NET Core host integration seams for service registration, policy evaluation, and host-boundary validation.

### CDCavell.AsiBackbone.Signing

Planned future package for signing and verification support around decision receipts, policy hashes, capability tokens, and audit records.

### CDCavell.AsiBackbone.Samples

Planned future samples or validation hosts.

Samples may include a console or worker host, a plain ASP.NET Core host, and a NetCoreApplicationTemplate-based host.

The plain ASP.NET Core host sample is the canonical in-repository validation baseline. NetCoreApplicationTemplate is documented separately as an optional external local validation host for developers who want to test AsiBackbone against a fuller enterprise-style application baseline.

### CDCavell.AsiBackbone.Robotics

Later integration package.

Robotics should remain a later-stage gateway example. The first release path should prove the policy, decision, acknowledgment, audit, capability-token, and gateway patterns before moving toward physical execution scenarios.

## Relationship to NetCoreApplicationTemplate

NetCoreApplicationTemplate may be used as a preferred host baseline during development and validation, but AsiBackbone should not require it.

The intended relationship is:

```text
NetCoreApplicationTemplate
    = preferred host baseline

AsiBackbone
    = optional governance/module package family

Consumer application
    = chooses whether to use either or both
```

A consumer should be able to use AsiBackbone in:

- an application generated from NetCoreApplicationTemplate
- an existing ASP.NET Core application
- a future custom host that provides the required infrastructure

For validation guidance, see [NetCoreApplicationTemplate Host Validation](docs/articles/netcoreapplicationtemplate-host-validation.md).

## Alignment Boundary

In this repository, ASI means **Accountable Systems Infrastructure**. AsiBackbone documentation may reference the broader Eden/Backbone framework as conceptual inspiration, but implementation claims should remain grounded in practical software governance.

Safe language:

- AsiBackbone stands for Accountable Systems Infrastructure Backbone.
- AsiBackbone implements governance-oriented software primitives.
- AsiBackbone helps structure consequential decision flow through constraints, acknowledgment, audit, and capability boundaries.
- AsiBackbone can surround intelligent or decision-producing systems with accountable execution infrastructure.
- AsiBackbone is inspired by broader Eden/Backbone governance concepts without claiming to implement artificial superintelligence.

Avoid language such as:

- AsiBackbone implements artificial superintelligence.
- AsiBackbone proves the Eden Hypothesis.
- AsiBackbone is an AI model.
- AsiBackbone replaces AI safety governance, legal review, or organizational accountability.

## Design Principles

- Keep Core small.
- Keep Core dependency-light.
- Avoid hidden host assumptions.
- Prefer explicit integration over magic.
- Let the host own infrastructure.
- Let integration packages own persistence, web integration, signing, storage, samples, and external execution concerns.
- Keep package boundaries clear before adding behavior.
- Treat NetCoreApplicationTemplate as a preferred host, not a parent framework.
- Treat AsiBackbone as Accountable Systems Infrastructure: governance infrastructure, not an intelligence engine.
